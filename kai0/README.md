χ₀ (**kai0**) is a resource-efficient framework for achieving production-level robustness in robotic manipulation by taming distributional inconsistencies.
<!-- This repository is built on top of [openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi), the open-source models and packages for robotics published by the [Physical Intelligence team](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/). -->

χ₀ addresses the systematic distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution ($P_\text{train}$), the inductive bias learned by the policy ($Q_\text{model}$), and the test-time execution distribution ($P_\text{test}$) through three technical modules:

- **[Model Arithmetic](#model-arithmetic)**: A weight-space merging strategy that combines models trained on different data subsets, efficiently capturing diverse knowledge without architectural complexity. **[Released]**
- **[Stage Advantage](#stage-advantage)**: A stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals for policy training. **[Released]**
- **[Train-Deploy Alignment](#train-deploy-alignment)**: Bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. **[Released]**

χ₀ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation — flattening, folding, and hanging — surpassing the state-of-the-art $\pi_{0.5}$ baseline by approximately 250% in success rate, with `only 20 hours of data and 8 A100 GPUs`.

## Acknowledgement

This repository is built on top of [openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) by [Physical Intelligence](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/). We sincerely thank the Physical Intelligence team for open-sourcing their excellent π₀ and π₀.₅ models and the openpi codebase, which made this work possible. The base model training, inference pipeline, and data processing utilities all originate from openpi. Please refer to the [openpi README](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) for details on the base models, fine-tuning, and inference.

## Requirements

### Compute

χ₀ shares the same system requirements as openpi. You will need an NVIDIA GPU with at least the following specifications:

| Mode               | Memory Required | Example GPU           |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Inference          | > 8 GB          | RTX 4090              |
| Fine-Tuning (LoRA) | > 22.5 GB       | RTX 4090 (not tested) |
| Fine-Tuning (Full) | > 70 GB         | A100 (80GB) / H100    |

For Model Arithmetic (mixing checkpoints), GPU memory requirements depend on the model size and number of checkpoints being mixed. A single A100 (80GB) is sufficient for most use cases.

Non-edge components (e.g., Policy Training, Model Arithmetic) have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

### Hardware

For real-robot deployment (dual-arm setup, cameras, and table layout), see **[Hardware Setup & 3D Print Files](setup/README.md)**. That document covers supported platforms (Agilex Piper for Task_A / Task_B, ARX X5 for Task_C), Intel RealSense D435i camera placement, 3D-printed grippers and mounts with usage notes, and inference host GPU (RTX 4090 in Ubuntu 20.04).

## Installation

When cloning this repo, make sure to update submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:OpenDriveLab/kai0.git

# Or if you already cloned the repo:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Follow the [openpi installation instructions](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi#installation) to set up the base environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv pip install -e .
```

For PyTorch checkpoint mixing (not tested thoroughly), ensure `safetensors` is installed:

```bash
uv pip install safetensors
```

## Preparation

### 1. Download the dataset

Download the Kai0 dataset so it is available under `./data` for training and evaluation. From the repository root, run:

```bash
python scripts/download_dataset.py
```

This fetches the full dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDriveLab-org/Kai0) into `./data` (Task_A, Task_B, Task_C). To download only specific tasks or use a custom path, see the [dataset docs](docs/dataset.md#step-1-download-the-dataset).

### 2. Download checkpoints (optional, for testing)

We provide **one best model per task** (Task_A, Task_B, Task_C) in the [Kai0 repo on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/OpenDriveLab-org/Kai0/tree/main).

From the repository root, you can download all best-model checkpoints to `./checkpoints` with:

```bash
python scripts/download_checkpoints.py
```

To download only specific tasks or use a custom path, run:

```bash
python scripts/download_checkpoints.py --tasks Task_A Task_C --local-dir ./my_checkpoints
```

After download, set `weight_loader` in the training config to the path of the corresponding checkpoint directory (see step 3 below). You can also use openpi’s pretrained π₀.5 checkpoint instead.

### 3. Fine-tune with normal π₀.₅

After the dataset is in `./data`, you can run **normal π₀.₅ full fine-tuning** on it, then use the resulting checkpoints for [Model Arithmetic](#model-arithmetic).

**Set paths in config**

Edit [`src/openpi/training/config.py`](src/openpi/training/config.py) (around lines 1173–1226) for the task(s) you need:

- **`repo_id`**: set to the **absolute path** to the dataset subset, e.g. `<path_to_repo_root>/data/Task_A/base`, `<path_to_repo_root>/data/Task_B/base`, or `<path_to_repo_root>/data/Task_C/base`.
- **`weight_loader`**: set to the path of your **π₀.₅ base checkpoint** — either the best model you downloaded in step 2 above, or openpi’s pretrained π₀.₅ checkpoint.

Config names to use: e.g. `pi05_flatten_fold_normal`

**Compute normalization stats with our optimized scripts**

```bash
uv run python scripts/compute_norm_states_fast.py --config-name <config_name>
```

Example: `uv run python scripts/compute_norm_states_fast.py --config-name pi05_flatten_fold_normal`

**Start training**

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 uv run scripts/train.py <config_name> --exp_name=<your_experiment_name>
```

Example: `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 uv run scripts/train.py pi05_flatten_fold_normal --exp_name=flatten_fold_run1`

Checkpoints are written to the config’s checkpoint directory. You can then use your checkpoints as inputs to **model arithmetic** (see [Model Arithmetic](#model-arithmetic)).

## Model Arithmetic

Model Arithmetic combines multiple trained openpi model checkpoints into a single mixed model using optimized weighted averaging. This enables efficiently aggregating knowledge from models trained on different data subsets (e.g., different object appearances, state variations) without requiring Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Both JAX (Orbax/OCDBT) and PyTorch checkpoints (`model.safetensors`, not tested thoroughly) are supported. Six mixing methods are available: **average** (equal weight \(1/N\) per checkpoint), **inverse_loss**, **gradient_descent**, **adaptive_gradient_descent**, **greedy**, and **manual weights**.

### Workflow

The mixing process follows three steps:

1. **(Optional)** Split a LeRobot dataset into subsets and train one model per subset.
2. Dump a small validation set for weight optimization.
3. Mix the checkpoints using one of the supported methods.

### Quick Start

Taking Task C (hanging clothes) as an example:

**Step 1: Dump validation data**

```bash
python model_arithmetic/dump_data.py \
  --dataset pi05_hang_cloth \
  --output hang_cloth_val.pkl
```

**Step 2: Mix checkpoints** (example using inverse_loss — fastest method, no gradient steps)

```bash
# JAX checkpoints
python model_arithmetic/arithmetic.py \
  --config pi05_hang_cloth \
  --data-path hang_cloth_val.pkl \
  --checkpoints \
    /path/to/ckpt_run1/90000 \
    /path/to/ckpt_run2/90000 \
    /path/to/ckpt_run3/90000 \
  --output /path/to/mixed_ckpt \
  --optimize_method inverse_loss \
  --use_gpu \
  --gpu_ids "0"

# PyTorch checkpoints (not tested thoroughly)
python model_arithmetic/arithmetic_torch.py \
  --config pi05_hang_cloth \
  --data-path hang_cloth_val.pkl \
  --checkpoints /path/to/torch_ckpt1 /path/to/torch_ckpt2 /path/to/torch_ckpt3 \
  --output /path/to/mixed_torch_ckpt \
  --optimize_method inverse_loss
```

For gradient-based optimization, dataset splitting, and all other methods, see the full documentation in [`model_arithmetic/README.md`](model_arithmetic/README.md).

## Stage Advantage

Stage Advantage decomposes long-horizon tasks into semantic stages and provides stage-aware advantage signals for policy training. It addresses the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches by computing advantage as progress differentials within each stage, yielding smoother and more stable supervision.

The full pipeline has five steps:

```
Step 0: Annotate stage_progress_gt (manual)  →  Step 1: Train Advantage Estimator  →  Step 2: Predict Advantage  →  Step 3: Discretize Advantage  →  Step 4: AWBC Training
```

### Quick Start

**Step 0 — Annotate `stage_progress_gt`** (manual, no code provided): For each episode, annotate start/end timestamps and subtask split points, then compute per-frame `stage_progress_gt` (linear progress 0→1 within each subtask) and write it into the parquet files.

**Step 1 — Train Advantage Estimator**: Fine-tune a pi0-based model to predict advantage from observations.

```bash
uv run python scripts/train_pytorch.py ADVANTAGE_TORCH_KAI0_FLATTEN_FOLD --exp_name=run1 --save_interval 10000
```

**Step 2 — Predict Advantage**: Use the trained estimator to label datasets with `absolute_advantage` and `relative_advantage`.

```bash
uv run python stage_advantage/annotation/eval.py Task-A KAI0 /path/to/dataset
```

**Step 3 — Discretize Advantage**: Bin predicted advantages into positive/negative `task_index` labels.

```bash
cd stage_advantage/annotation
python discretize_advantage.py <dataset_path> \
    --threshold 30 --chunk-size 50 --discretion-type binary \
    --advantage-source absolute_advantage
```

For batch labeling across PI06/KAI0 variants, see `stage_advantage/annotation/discretize_advantage.sh`.

**Step 4 — AWBC Training**: Train a policy with Advantage-Weighted Behavior Cloning.

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 uv run scripts/train.py pi05_flatten_fold_awbc --exp_name=run1
```

For the full pipeline details, configuration instructions, and all parameters, see [`stage_advantage/README.md`](stage_advantage/README.md).

## Train-Deploy Alignment

Train-Deploy Alignment bridges the distribution gap between training and real-world deployment through three sub-modules:

- **Data Augmentation** (`train_deploy_alignment/data_augment/`): Time scaling (frame extraction at configurable rates), space mirroring (left/right arm swap + video flip), dataset merging, and HDF5-to-LeRobot format conversion.
- **DAgger** (`train_deploy_alignment/dagger/`): Policy-in-the-loop data collection for both Agilex Piper and ARX X5 platforms. Operators run inference, switch to DAgger mode for human corrections, and save episodes (HDF5 + optional videos + intervention labels).
- **Inference** (`train_deploy_alignment/inference/`): Deployment code for Agilex and ARX robots with multiple execution modes — synchronous, temporal smoothing, temporal ensembling, and **RTC (real-time chunking)**. Uses a two-machine setup (GPU policy server + robot IPC client).

### Quick Start

**Data Augmentation — Time scaling:**

```bash
python train_deploy_alignment/data_augment/time_scaling.py \
  --src_path /path/to/source --tgt_path /path/to/extracted --repo_id extracted_dataset \
  --extraction_factor 2
```

**Data Augmentation — Space mirroring (mirror + merge):**

```bash
python train_deploy_alignment/data_augment/space_mirroring.py full \
  --src-path /path/to/original --mirror-path /path/to/mirrored --merge-path /path/to/merged \
  --repo-id my_dataset
```

**DAgger — Agilex:** Start the policy server on the GPU host, then on the IPC:

```bash
conda activate kai0_inference
python train_deploy_alignment/dagger/agilex/agilex_openpi_dagger_collect.py \
  --host <gpu_host_ip> --port 8000 --ctrl_type joint --use_temporal_smoothing --chunk_size 50 \
  --dataset_name <your_dataset_name>
```

**Inference — Agilex (temporal smoothing):** Start the policy server on the GPU host, then on the IPC:

```bash
conda activate kai0_inference
python inference/agilex_inference_openpi_temporal_smoothing.py \
  --host <gpu_host_ip> --port 8000 --ctrl_type joint --use_temporal_smoothing --chunk_size 50
```

**Inference — ARX (RTC mode):** Start the policy server with an RTC config, then on the IPC:

```bash
python inference/arx_openpi_inference_rtc.py --host <gpu_host_ip> --port 8000 --rtc_mode --chunk_size 50
```

For full setup instructions (IPC environment, CAN, ROS/ROS2, platform-specific details), see [`train_deploy_alignment/README.md`](train_deploy_alignment/README.md).
